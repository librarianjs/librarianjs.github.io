# Creating a Cache Plugin

Cache plugins are used to cache image data so that slower or more expensive storage
solutions (e.g. Amazon S3) are not touched more than necessary if a file is accessed repeatedly in a short time window.

A cache plugin must implement a `get` and `put` method. The speed of cache invalidation is up to the specific library to decide.

## Methods

### get(id)

get will be called with an image id, it will look something like this.

{% highlight javascript %}
plugin.get('343fd021-c37e-4e79-850e-d013bae00b3b')
{% endhighlight %}

It should return a promise that resolves with a buffer of image data:
{% highlight text %}
<Buffer 47 49 46 38 39 61 3d 00 44 00 f7 a8 00 9a 2c 33 ...>
{% endhighlight %}

If there is no record that matches the key, the promise should resolve with `null`.

**NOTE:** The only reason the promise should ever reject is if there was some sort of fetching error (e.g. Redis crashes randomly). A missing key is a normal occurrence, do not error for this.

### put(id, record)

put will be called with a record that looks like the following:
{% highlight javascript %}
plugin.put('e10a0a08-1688-4dff-8a26-fea6ff32e2d4', imageDataBuffer)
{% endhighlight %}

It should return a promise that resolves when the record has been successfully saved, and rejects if there was some problem saving the file.

### init()

Any plugin may also (optionally) provide an `init` method.
If one is found, librarian will wait until the `init()` promise resolves before processing requests.

This is a good way for plugins to check for the availability of external resources.

The `init()` promise should resolve when the plugin is good to go,
and should reject if the plugin will never be able to function correctly.
An example of this would be invalid api keys for the [S3 Storage](https://github.com/librarianjs/s3-storage) plugin or bad connection details for the [Mysql Data](https://github.com/librarianjs/mysql-data) plugin.

## Tests

Your plugin should pass the [cache plugin tests](https://github.com/librarianjs/librarian/blob/master/plugin-tests/cache-plugin.js).
